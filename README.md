Use all player stats and be able to predict whether someone would be a good candidate for the NFL. Want to create a model to predict if a given person would be a good fit for the NFL, predict hall of fame, predict years in NFL, and more.

Look into college stats - join college stats to NFL stats and use Ttest to determine performance difference, if applicable.

Use structural equation modeling to find links between variables.

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
combine <- read_csv("nfl.combine.csv")
combine.rnd <- str_split_fixed(combine$Drafted..tm.rnd.yr.,'/',4)
combine1 <- bind_cols(combine,combine.rnd)
combine2 <- combine1[,-c(13,16,22)]
names(combine2) <- c("Year", "Player Name", "Age", "School", "Height", "Weight", "40 Yd Dash", "Vertical Jump", " Bench Press(Reps)", "Broad Jump", "3 Cone Agility", "20 Yd Shuttle", "BMI", "Player Type", "Postion", "Drafted", "Team", "Round Drafted","Pick Number")
```
